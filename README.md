## Final projects
- Palindrome Checker:
Returns true if the given string is a palindrome. 
Otherwise, returns false. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same 
way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, 
case, and spacing.

- Roman Numeral Converter:
Converts the given number into a roman numeral.

- Caesars Cipher:
Takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

- Cash Register:
A cash register drawer function that accepts purchase price, payment, and cash-in-drawer as arguments.
Return an object with a status key and a change key. Return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order.
Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.
Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.
